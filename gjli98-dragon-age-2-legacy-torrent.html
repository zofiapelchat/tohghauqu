The tournament was best of three, three rounds of swiss, then cutting to Top 4 (proxies were allowed). Ten players attended, and some with strong competitive experience. Our winner, Shane Duckworth, from Las Vegas, Nevada is a former UFS World Teams Champion, 5-time UFS Pro Tour Circuit Champion, and a UFS 2k Champion.
