                            <p>Hi, I have this project for a login page. There are three login information username, password and usercode. I have to handle all the errors. So far, when all empty inputs, it will return to the Main.jsp. When the username is wrong, the error message will display correctly. But when the username is right and other two are wrong, the page will turn to a blank page instead of showing "password and usercode are wrong". Please help me with this. I also have a question about how to make the textfield.

Hi everyone, I'm currently jumping into the world of SAP Business Intelligence, and i'm going through some practice runs of the installation. I've hit a bit of a roadblock configuring the database connection. MySQL and IPS have been installed successfully, and I'm currently at the point of the installer where you configure the DataServices Repository.

I think a while ago one of the Java architects asked an audience if they like Java 8 streams and the majority of the audience said yes (can't find the link). But let's compare doing something non-trivial but fictitious with Java 8, Scala, and Kotlin to illustrate the problems with Java 8's implementation of streams and functions on those streams: Here's the problem: 1.

Fuck me in the ass with a lemon-soaked cactus, college and university were bullshit. Let's start with my time in community college, which started with me fighting for months with the stupid bastards over whether or not I counted as an in-state student after having lived in said state for over a year with adequate documentation backing up my claim. I was, after several lengthy phone conversations, informed when I did a daily checkup on how badly they were deciding This is my first time creating a spring boot application following some youtube videos and for some reason the eclipse console has been stuck.

Hi! I have a very simple JavaFX app that pulls the data from the MySQL database. Everything works, but I need to add a sorting option (any type). Any help is much appreciated!

Java Help - MySQL (multiple connections at once) freezes the program for a little bit My program has as single table with information in it and I have a bunch of JTextFields that each have there own connection to change the number of whats updated. So for example if jTextField1 is set to get the max number of only the month of july and jTextField2 is only set to get the max number of only the month of august, well when I make changes and click my Update button, it runs a connection I genuinely need suggestions here. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. I need to make an app for managing a database of students and their grades for different subjects on different courses, all within less than 2 months. Unfortunately, my experience in programming has always been in desktop dev, and even so, I mostly do stuff with algorithms, 3D graphics, and file processing, and my experience with databases have been limited to just embedded single-user databases. Hi, I have created simple CRUD console program. All of the database functionalities work correctly, but I have errors while trying to exit this program by typing proper menu number. I think it is related somehow with closing entityManager or entityManagerFactory. My code: main: import domain.Employee; import domain.EmployeeRepository; import jpa.utils.JPAUtils; import java.util.Scanner; import static jpa.utils.JPAUtils.entityManager; import static jpa.utils.J. 
How can I do this with MySQL? I want to set each row color based on the id number or the month value text.My table code: (I provided examples I worked with below to implement this but it does not work.) public ArrayListltSQLLoadsAllgt SQLLoadsList(){ ArrayListltSQLLoadsAllgt SQLLoadsList = new ArrayListltgt(); try{ Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"); String username = "UserFake"; String password = "Pass. I have about 30 jTextFields that are loaded and update with the ArrayList code below. My problem is that each Try{} has their own String query and my while(rs.next() is used to check the state of that try{} so that each JTextField is each individually updated correctly on their own. It works completely but takes about 10 seconds to load on start up and about 10 seconds to run the ArrayList and update. I discovered Statement batch yesterday but unsure how I can implement it in my scenario success. I'm still a Clojure newbie so I'm not 100% sure how the community is using tagged literals. But I assume they're most useful when transmitting data over the wire. One thing that worried me when I started learning Clojure was that there's an #inst literal but no #date literal and I had fears this would be the whole java.util.Date/java.sql.Date problem all over again with users and libraries hijacking the usage of #inst to represent dates-without-time since there's no official built-in #date liter. MySQL provides standards-based drivers for JDBC, ODBC, and Net enabling developers to build database applications in their language of choice. In addition.
